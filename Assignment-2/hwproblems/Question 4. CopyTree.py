Time: __mins
Solution: __mins
Testcases: __mins

Given a binary tree, create a deep copy. Return the root of the new tree.

Algorithm: bfs
Time Complexity O(n) - looking at every node of the input tree, making a new tree
Space Complexity O(n) - Making the new tree will take O(n) space, that is the space of the input tree
