Question 4. CopyTree
Time: __mins
Solution: __mins
Testcases: __mins

Given a binary tree, create a deep copy. Return the root of the new tree.

Algorithm: bfs level order traversal
Time Complexity O(n) - looking at every node of the input tree
Space Complexity O(n) - Making the new tree will take O(n) space, that is the space of the input tree

Information we know
    - we need to make a deep copy, so create a new node with the value associated with the corresponding tree

Edge Cases
    - Null tree, return null tree
    
Assumptions
    - 
    
Difficulties
    - 
    
Approach
    - bfs level order
    a) for every element in the queue, create
