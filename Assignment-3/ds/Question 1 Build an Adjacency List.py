Question 1: Build an Adjacency List/Set Representation of a Graph

Given an array of pairs of values representing edges in an unweighted graph, 
create the equivalent adjacency list/set representation (a map from element to a list or set of elements). 
Pairs represent directed edges: (A, B) means there is an edge from A to B. 
If the pair (B, A) is also provided then there is an undirected edge between A and B. For simplicity, 
you may assume that each node of the graph stores an integer rather than a generic data type and that the elements are distinct. 
Implement a basic DFS and BFS searching for a target value and a topological sort (using either DFS or Kahnâ€™s algorithm).

Algorithm/DS: Adjacency List - HashMap, DFS, Topological Sort

Approach pseduocode
    Given the array of pairs - representing edges, if either of the nodes (both source and destination) aren't in the map, add them,
    use empty array's as values.
